    "Asks clarifying questions and incorporates hints": "Proficient: Asks clarifying questions and/or incorporates hints.",
    "Verifies assumptions": "Exceptional: Thoroughly verifies multiple assumptions and constraints.",
    "Demonstrates understanding w/ example inputs & outputs": "Exceptional: Provides multiple clear and insightful examples.",
    "Identifies multiple high-level approaches": "Proficient: Identifies and mentions more than one high-level approach.",
    "Determines time & space complexity of each high-level approach": "Proficient: Determines time and space complexity for at least one approach.",
    "Selects appropriate data structure(s) and/or programming approach": "Exceptional: Selects and justifies appropriate data structures and/or approaches with clear reasoning.",
    "Writes valid, concise, easy to read, and syntactically correct code for the full algorithm": "Developing: Attempts to describe code logic but may be unclear, incomplete or lack structure.",
    "Uses proper indentation to make code readable": "N/A: Cannot be assessed from transcript without code.",
    "Selects descriptive names for variables/functions that follow standard casing conventions": "N/A: Cannot be assessed from transcript unless variable/function names are mentioned.",
    "Manually tests code by verifying output for sample inputs": "Exceptional: Thoroughly tests code with multiple sample inputs and verifies outputs.",
    "Able to track down bugs effectively without resorting to \u201cguessing\u201d what is wrong": "Not Demonstrated: Limited or ineffective debugging, or resorts to guessing.",
    "Solution handles edge cases": "Developing: Mentions edge cases but handling might be incomplete or unclear.",
    "Verbalizes thought process throughout": "Developing: Sometimes verbalizes thought process, but may be inconsistent or brief.",
    "Uses sufficient vocal volume": "N/A: Cannot be assessed from text transcript.",
    "Maintains positive tone and body language throughout": "N/A: Body language and tone (reliably) cannot be assessed from text transcript.",
